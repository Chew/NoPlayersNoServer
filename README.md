Welcome to NoPlayersNoServer.

## Lore
I made this plugin when my friend and I had a server that I wanted to stop after a few minutes when we log off. Instead of looking for a plugin, I made one!

## Config.yml Breakdown
* `shutdownAfter` - Time (in ms) after the last person logs off to shut down the server.

## Notes

The server will not shut down until the last person person leaves, so whatever config you set will not take effect until the last person leaves.

Tested so far only on 1.14.4 and 1.15.2 let me know if it doesn't work for you!

This is my first plugin, if there's any bugs please throw them on GitHub, not in the reviews.

The source code is public, feel free to PR some stuff thanks
